# Calculate-Math-Expression
calculate a string math expression, using postfix representation and a binary tree  

Assumptions:  
-Supported operators are '+','-','*','/' (parenthesis are allowed as well)  
-The operands are numbers between 0 and 9 only(as for now)   

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the infix expression  
Space Complexity: O(n)
